	abstract = {Models of electrical excitation and recovery in the heart have become increasingly detailed, but have yet to be used routinely in the clinical setting to guide personalized intervention in patients. One of the main challenges is calibrating models from the limited measurements that can be made in a patient during a standard clinical procedure. In this work, we propose a novel framework for the probabilistic calibration of electrophysiology parameters on the left atrium of the heart using local measurements of cardiac excitability. Parameter fields are represented as Gaussian processes on manifolds and are linked to measurements via surrogate functions that map from local parameter values to measurements. The posterior distribution of parameter fields is then obtained. We show that our method can recover parameter fields used to generate localised synthetic measurements of effective refractory period. Our methodology is applicable to other measurement types collected with clinical protocols, and more generally for calibration where model parameters vary over a manifold.},

	abstract = {Atrial fibrillation is an increasingly common condition. Computational models that describe left atrial electrophysiology have the potential to be used to guide interventions such as catheter ablation. Calibration of these models to faithfully represent left atrial structure and function in a particular patient is challenging because electrophysiology observations obtained in the clinical setting are typically sparse and noisy, and can be difficult to register to a mesh obtained from imaging. Probabilistic approaches show promise as a way to obtain personalised models while taking account of noise, sparseness, and uncertainty. We have developed a workflow in which parameter fields are represented as Gaussian processes, and the posterior distribution is inferred using MCMC. Our workflow has been tested using synthetic data, generated from simulations where the spatial variation in model parameters is known, and we have shown that both features and parameters can be recovered from simulated sparse measurements.},

One metric that characterizes the health of the myocardial substrate is atrial conduction velocity, which describes the speed and direction of propagation of the electrical wavefront through the myocardium. Atrial conduction velocity mapping algorithms are under continuous development in research laboratories and in industry. In this review article, we give a broad overview of different categories of currently published methods for calculating CV, and give insight into their different advantages and disadvantages overall. We classify techniques into local, global, and inverse methods, and discuss these techniques with respect to their faithfulness to the biophysics, incorporation of uncertainty quantification, and their ability to take account of the atrial manifold.},

	abstract = {In patients with atrial fibrillation, local activation time (LAT) maps are routinely used for characterizing patient pathophysiology. The gradient of LAT maps can be used to calculate conduction velocity (CV), which directly relates to material conductivity and may provide an important measure of atrial substrate properties. Including uncertainty in CV calculations would help with interpreting the reliability of these measurements. Here, we build upon a recent insight into reduced-rank Gaussian processes (GPs) to perform probabilistic interpolation of uncertain LAT directly on human atrial manifolds. Our Gaussian process manifold interpolation (GPMI) method accounts for the topology of the atrium, and allows for calculation of statistics for predicted CV. We demonstrate our method on two clinical cases, and perform validation against a simulated ground truth. CV uncertainty depends on data density, wave propagation direction and CV magnitude. GPMI is suitable for probabilistic interpolation of other uncertain quantities on non-Euclidean manifolds.

	abstract = {Objective: Local activation time (LAT) mapping of the atria is important for targeted treatment of atrial arrhythmias, but current methods do not interpolate on the atrial manifold and neglect uncertainties associated with LAT observations. In this paper, we describe novel methods to, first, quantify uncertainties in LAT arising from bipolar electrogram analysis and assignment of electrode recordings to the anatomical mesh, second, interpolate uncertain LAT measurements directly on left atrial manifolds to obtain complete probabilistic activation maps, and finally, interpolate LAT jointly across both the manifold and different S1-S2 pacing protocols. Methods: A modified center of mass approach was used to process bipolar electrograms, yielding a LAT estimate and error distribution from the electrogram morphology. An error distribution for assigning measurements to the anatomical mesh was estimated. Probabilistic LAT maps were produced by interpolating on a left atrial manifold using Gaussian Markov random fields, taking into account observation errors and characterizing LAT predictions by their mean and standard deviation. This approach was extended to interpolate across S1-S2 pacing protocols. Results: We evaluated our approach using recordings from three patients undergoing atrial ablation. Cross-validation showed consistent and accurate prediction of LAT observations both at different locations on the left atrium and for different S1-S2 intervals. Significance: Interpolation of scalar and vector fields across anatomical structures from point measurements is a challenging problem in biomedical engineering, compounded by uncertainties in measurements and meshes. New methods and approaches are required, and in this paper, we have demonstrated an effective method for probabilistic interpolation of uncertain LAT.},

Restitution curves provide information on tissue function and can be measured using clinically feasible measurement protocols. We introduce novel “restitution curve emulators” as probabilistic models for performing model exploration, sensitivity analysis, and Bayesian calibration to noisy data. These emulators are built by decomposing restitution curves using principal component analysis and modeling the resulting coordinates with respect to model parameters using Gaussian processes. Restitution curve emulators can be used to study parameter identifiability via sensitivity analysis of restitution curve components and rapid inference of the posterior distribution of model parameters given noisy measurements. Posterior uncertainty about parameters is critical for making predictions from calibrated models, since many parameter settings can be consistent with measured data and yet produce very different model behaviors under conditions not effectively probed by the measurement protocols. Restitution curve emulators are therefore promising probabilistic tools for calibrating electrophysiology models.},

Action potentials in real cardiac cells also vary from beat to beat, and from one cell to another. Calibrating cardiac cell models to experimental observations is difficult, because the parameter space is large and high-dimensional. In this study we have demonstrated the use of history matching to calibrate the maximum conductance of ion channels and exchangers in two detailed models of the human atrial action potential against measurements of action potential biomarkers. History matching is an approach developed in other modelling communities, based on constructing fast-running Gaussian process emulators of the model. Emulators were constructed from a small number of model runs (around 102), and then run many times ({\textgreater}106) at low computational cost, each time with a different set of model parameters. Emulator outputs were compared with experimental biomarkers using an implausibility measure, which took into account experimental variance as well as emulator variance. By repeating this process, the region of non-implausible parameter space was iteratively reduced. Both cardiac cell models were successfully calibrated to experimental datasets, resulting in sets of parameters that could be sampled to produce variable action potentials. However, model parameters did not occupy a small range of values. Instead, the history matching process exposed inputs that can co-vary across a wide range and still be consistent with a particular biomarker. We also found correlations between some biomarkers, indicating a need for better descriptors of action potential shape.},

	abstract = {Biophysically detailed cardiac cell models reconstruct the action potential and calcium dynamics of cardiac myocytes. They aim to capture the biophysics of current flow through ion channels, pumps, and exchangers in the cell membrane, and are highly detailed. However, the relationship between model parameters and model outputs is difficult to establish because the models are both complex and non-linear. The consequences of uncertainty and variability in model parameters are therefore difficult to determine without undertaking large numbers of model evaluations. The aim of the present study was to demonstrate how sensitivity and uncertainty analysis using Gaussian process emulators can be used for a systematic and quantitive analysis of biophysically detailed cardiac cell models. We selected the Courtemanche and Maleckar models of the human atrial action potential for analysis because these models describe a similar set of currents, with different formulations. In our approach Gaussian processes emulate the main features of the action potential and calcium transient. The emulators were trained with a set of design data comprising samples from parameter space and corresponding model outputs, initially obtained from 300 model evaluations. Variance based sensitivity indices were calculated using the emulators, and first order and total effect indices were calculated for each combination of parameter and output. The differences between the first order and total effect indices indicated that the effect of interactions between parameters was small. A second set of emulators were then trained using a new set of design data with a subset of the model parameters with a sensitivity index of more than 0.1 (10\%). This second stage analysis enabled comparison of mechanisms in the two models. The second stage sensitivity indices enabled the relationship between the L-type Ca2+ current and the action potential plateau to be quantified in each model. Our quantitative analysis predicted that changes in maximum conductance of the ultra-rapid K+ channel IKur would have opposite effects on action potential duration in the two models, and this prediction was confirmed by additional simulations. This study has demonstrated that Gaussian process emulators are an effective tool for sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of biophysically detailed cardiac cell models.},

	abstract = {Background.
Personalised computer models are increasingly used to diagnose cardiac arrhythmias and tailor treatment. Patient-specific models of the left atrium are often derived from pre-procedural imaging of anatomy and fibrosis. These images contain noise that can affect simulation predictions. There are few computationally tractable methods for propagating uncertainties from images to clinical predictions.
Method.
We describe the left atrium anatomy using our Bayesian shape model that captures anatomical uncertainty in medical images and has been validated on 63 independent clinical images. This algorithm describes the left atrium anatomy using Nmodes=15 principal components, capturing 95\% of the shape variance and calculated from 70 clinical cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images. Latent variables encode shape uncertainty: we evaluate their posterior distribution for each new anatomy. We assume a normally distributed prior. We use the unscented transform to sample from the posterior shape distribution. For each sample, we assign the local material properties of the tissue using the projection of late gadolinium enhancement CMR (LGE-CMR) onto the anatomy to estimate local fibrosis. To test which activation patterns an atrium can sustain, we perform an arrhythmia simulation for each sample. We consider 34 possible outcomes (31 macro-re-entries, functional re-entry, atrial fibrillation, and non-sustained arrhythmia). For each sample, we determine the outcome by comparing pre- and post-ablation activation patterns following a cross-field stimulus.
Results.
We create patient-specific atrial electrophysiology models of ten patients. We validate the mean and standard deviation maps from the unscented transform with the same statistics obtained with 12,000 Monte Carlo (ground truth) samples. We found discrepancies {\textless}3\% and {\textless}2\% for the mean and standard deviation for fibrosis burden and activation time, respectively. For each patient case, we then compare the predicted outcome from a model built on the clinical data (deterministic approach) with the probability distribution obtained from the simulated samples. We found that the deterministic approach did not predict the most likely outcome in 80\% of the cases. Finally, we estimate the influence of each source of uncertainty independently. Fixing the anatomy to the posterior mean and maintaining uncertainty in fibrosis reduced the prediction of self-terminating arrhythmias from ≃14\% to ≃7\%. Keeping the fibrosis fixed to the sample mean while retaining uncertainty in shape decreased the prediction of substrate-driven arrhythmias from ≃33\% to ≃18\% and increased the prediction of macro-re-entries from ≃54\% to ≃68\%.
Conclusions.
We presented a novel method for propagating shape uncertainty in atrial models through to uncertainty in numerical simulations. The algorithm takes advantage of the unscented transform to compute the output distribution of the outcomes. We validated the unscented transform as a viable sampling strategy to deal with anatomy uncertainty. We then showed that the prediction computed with a deterministic model does not always coincide with the most likely outcome. Finally, we found that shape uncertainty affects the predictions of macro-re-entries, while fibrosis uncertainty affects the predictions of functional re-entries.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper presents a hierarchical modeling approach for estimating cardiomyocyte major and minor diameters and intracellular volume fraction (ICV) using diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) data in ex vivo mouse hearts.
Methods: DWI data were acquired on two healthy controls and two hearts 3 weeks post transverse aortic constriction (TAC) using a bespoke diffusion scheme with multiple diffusion times (Δ), q-shells and diffusion encoding directions. Firstly, a bi-exponential tensor model was fitted separately at each diffusion time to disentangle the dependence on diffusion times from diffusion weightings, that is, b-values. The slow-diffusing component was attributed to the restricted diffusion inside cardiomyocytes. ICV was then extrapolated at Δ = 0 using linear regression. Secondly, given the secondary and the tertiary diffusion eigenvalue measurements for the slow-diffusing component obtained at different diffusion times, major and minor diameters were estimated assuming a cylinder model with an elliptical cross-section (ECS). High-resolution three-dimensional synchrotron X-ray imaging (SRI) data from the same specimen was utilized to evaluate the biophysical parameters.
Results: Estimated parameters using DWI data were (control 1/control 2 vs. TAC 1/TAC 2): major diameter—17.4 𝜇m/18.0 𝜇m versus 19.2 𝜇m/19.0 𝜇m; minor diameter—10.2 𝜇m/9.4 𝜇m versus 12.8 𝜇m/13.4 𝜇m; and ICV—62\%/62\% versus 68\%/47\%. These findings were consistent with SRI measurements.
Conclusion: The proposed method allowed for accurate estimation of biophysical parameters suggesting cardiomyocyte diameters as sensitive biomarkers of hypertrophy in the heart.},

Models of anatomy are often derived after segmentation of clinical images or from mapping systems which are affected by image artefacts, resolution and contrast. Quantifying the impact of uncertain anatomy on model predictions is important, as models are increasingly used in clinical practice where decisions need to be made regardless of image quality. We use a Bayesian probabilistic approach to estimate the anatomy and to quantify the uncertainty about the shape of the left atrium derived from Cardiac Magnetic Resonance images. We show that we can quantify uncertain shape, encode uncertainty about the left atrial shape due to imaging artefacts, and quantify the effect of uncertain shape on simulations of left atrial activation times.},

The increased use of patient-specific cardiac simulations in clinical care will give rise to the development of virtual cohorts of cardiac models. These cohorts will allow cardiac simulations to capture and quantify inter-patient variability. However, the development of virtual cohorts of cardiac models will require the transformation of cardiac modelling from small numbers of bespoke models to robust and rapid workflows that can create large numbers of models. In this review, we describe the state of the art in virtual cohorts of cardiac models, the process of creating virtual cohorts of cardiac models, and how to generate the individual cohort member models, followed by a discussion of the potential and future applications of virtual cohorts of cardiac models.

              cardiac models offer a systematic approach for studying these multi-scale interactions. The computational cost of such models is high, due to their multi-parametric and nonlinear nature. This has so far made it difficult to perform model fitting and prevented global sensitivity analysis (GSA) studies. We propose a machine learning approach based on Gaussian process emulation of model simulations using probabilistic surrogate models, which enables model parameter inference via a Bayesian history matching (HM) technique and GSA on whole-organ mechanics. This framework is applied to model healthy and aortic-banded hypertensive rats, a commonly used animal model of heart failure disease. The obtained probabilistic surrogate models accurately predicted the left ventricular pump function (
              R
              2
               = 0.92 for ejection fraction). The HM technique allowed us to fit both the control and diseased virtual bi-ventricular rat heart models to magnetic resonance imaging and literature data, with model outputs from the constrained parameter space falling within 2 SD of the respective experimental values. The GSA identified Troponin C and cross-bridge kinetics as key parameters in determining both systolic and diastolic ventricular function.

Although one method for detecting myocardial ischaemia involves changes in the ST segment of the electrocardiogram, the relationship between these changes and subendocardial ischaemia is not fully understood. In this study, we modelled ST-segment epicardial potentials in a slab model of cardiac ventricular tissue, with a central ischaemic region, using the bidomain model, which considers conduction longitudinal, transverse and normal to the cardiac fibres. We systematically quantified the effect of uncertainty on the input parameters, fibre rotation angle, ischaemic depth, blood conductivity and six bidomain conductivities, on outputs that characterise the epicardial potential distribution. We found that three typical types of epicardial potential distributions (one minimum over the central ischaemic region, a tripole of minima, and two minima flanking a central maximum) could all occur for a wide range of ischaemic depths. In addition, the positions of the minima were affected by both the fibre rotation angle and the ischaemic depth, but not by changes in the conductivity values. We also showed that the magnitude of ST depression is affected only by changes in the longitudinal and normal conductivities, but not by the transverse conductivities.},

	abstract = {A liquid drop spreading over a thin heterogeneous precursor ﬁlm (such as an inhaled droplet on the mucus-lined wall of a lung airway) will experience perturbations in shape and location as its advancing contact line encounters regions of low or high ﬁlm viscosity. Prior work on spatially one-dimensional spreading over a precursor ﬁlm having a random viscosity ﬁeld (Xu and Jensen, Proc R Soc A 472:20160270, 2016) has demonstrated how viscosity ﬂuctuations are swept into a narrow region behind the drop’s effective contact line, where they can impact drop dynamics. In this paper, we investigate two-dimensional drops, seeking to understand the relationship between the statistical properties of the precursor ﬁlm and those of the spreading drop. Assuming the precursor ﬁlm is much thinner than the drop and viscosity ﬂuctuations are weak, we use asymptotic methods to derive explicit predictions for the mean and variance of drop area and the drop’s lateral drift. For larger ﬁlm variability, we use Gaussian process emulation to estimate the variance of outcomes from a restricted set of simulations. Stochastic drift of the droplet is predicted to be the greatest when the initial drop diameter is comparable to the correlation length of viscosity ﬂuctuations.},

	abstract = {Cardiac cell models have become valuable research tools, but biophysically detailed models embed large numbers of parameters, which must be fitted from experimental data. The provenance of these parameters can be difficult to establish, and so it is important to understand how parameter values influence model behaviour. In this study we examined how model parameters influence the repolarising current \$\$I\_\{Kr\}\$\$in the Courtemenache-Ramirez-Nattel model of the human atrial action potential. We used a statistical approach in which Gaussian processes (GP) are used to emulate the model outputs. A GP emulator can treat model inputs and outputs as uncertain, and so can be used to directly calculate sensitivity indices. We found that 3 of the 10 parameters influencing \$\$I\_\{Kr\}\$\$had a strong influence on \$\$APD\_\{70\}\$\$, \$\$APD\_\{90\}\$\$, and Dome \$\$V\_m\$\$. These three parameters scale the magnitude of the \$\$I\_\{Kr\}\$\$gating variable time constant and the voltage dependence of the steady state activation curve, and these mechanisms act to modify the amplitude of \$\$I\_\{Kr\}\$\$during repolarisation. This study highlights the potential value of statistical approaches for investigating cardiac models, and that uncertainties or errors in parameters resulting from attempts to fit experimental data during model development can ultimately affect model behaviour.},
