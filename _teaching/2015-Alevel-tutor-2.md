I worked as a private A-level tutor in physics and maths in Sheffield, for students at various levels of ability. Mostly, I assisted with teaching the students things that they had not grasped from their lessons, and helped them to understand how to solve homework problems and past exam questions that they were stuck on.

This was a valuable learning experience for myself. There was a need to empirically test the students' abilities, when not guided by myself/course notes/answer sheets, which I had not appreciated the importance of at the beginning. I tried to impart good self-learning practices that would help the students' to get a more accurate view of their own abilities, so that they could take these lessons with them to higher education.
