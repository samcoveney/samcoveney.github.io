Under my own business _ScienceAble Skills_, I designed and delivered a 3-day programming course called _CUDA for Scientists_. This course was designed to teach the paradigms behind programming in the language CUDA, which allowed for writing programs that executed on Graphical Processing Units (GPUs). Alongside course notes and example code, I provided a custom-built linux server hosting multiple low-spec GPUs that allowed participants to compile and run code during the practical sessions.

See here for the CUDA for Scientists [course notes]('http://samcoveney.github.io/files/cuda_for_scientists.pdf') and [workshop code]('http://samcoveney.github.io/files/CFS_workshop_code.zip') - be aware that the CUDA programming language has very likely evolved significantly since I delivered these courses, and that there are now easier ways to utilize the power of graphics cards!
