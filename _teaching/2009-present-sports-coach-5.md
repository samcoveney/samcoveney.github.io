I have been teaching sport aikido, which is similar to judo, since 2009 when I took over responsibility for running many of the sessions for student members from the University of Sheffield and Sheffield Hallam University.

Since this time, I have taught many students on their journey to black belt and beyond. I also travelled regularly to Leeds and Nottingham to teach sessions for their students and for their instructors. I have various national level events, including seminars of 50+ attendees and national squad training sessions. I have also redesigned the national syllabus used in many student clubs, and run events to help clubs implement new training methods, including those brought back by myself from trips to Japan.

Currently, I now jointly run the Kyogikan dojo in Sheffield as the business co-chair and joint head-coach. Now my own competing career is mostly over, I am involved in redeveloping teaching methods for the next generation of student members.
