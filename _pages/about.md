I am a postdoctoral researcher working in Leeds Institute of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Medicine at the University of Leeds, currently working on cardiac diffusion tensor imaging. I previously worked at the University of Sheffield working on uncertainty quantification methods aimed at calibration of cardiac digital twins. Before my shift to uncertainty quantification focussed on electrophysiology, I did my PhD in theoretical physics working on polymer blend thin films.
